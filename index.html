        <p>Hello! My name is John Shirley, I am from Cumming Georgia. I have been working on the CIT (Computer Information Technology) major. I hope that one day I can find a job in cyber security and help people stay safe on the internet. A couple of my hobbies would be going outside to practice shooting, playing pickle ball and disc golf, pc gaming, and going on runs. I‚Äôm very interested in AI and just watching it learn and grow. I someday want to help make an AI that can help with keeping your personal data safe and out of the hands of anyone who wants to steal it. </p>
